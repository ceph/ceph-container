# DOCKER-VERSION 1.0.0

# Ceph Config
#
#  USAGE NOTES:
#    - Define at least the two following environment variables:
#      MONHOST - the hostname of this monitor
#      MONIP   - the (externally visible) IP address of this monitor
#    - /etc/ceph is set as a volume, so you may use a common configuration directory
#      among your ceph daemons (this also keeps private keys outside of the image)
