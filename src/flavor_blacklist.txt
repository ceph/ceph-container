# Use this blacklist to prevent certain files from being staged for given
# build flavors.
# This could be useful, for example, to prevent versions of ceph before luminous
# from getting configs/files relating to nfs-ganesha.
#
# How to use this file:
#  1. Lines beginning with some number of spaces followed by '#' are a comment.
      # e.g., this is also a comment
#  2. Blacklist format "<path to be blacklisted> <ENV_VAR1>=<val1> <ENV_VAR2>=<val2> ...
#     a. Any number of environment variables can be specified. A path will be blacklisted only if
#        all given environment variables match their expected values.
#        e.g., The line '/some/file BASEOS_REG=ubuntu BASEOS_TAG=16.04'
#              matches ubuntu:16.04 but not ubuntu:18.04
#     b. <path to be blacklisted> can be individual files or directories.
