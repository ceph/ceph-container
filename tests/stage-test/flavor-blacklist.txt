# Use this blacklist to prevent certain files from being staged for given
# build flavors.
# This could be useful, for example, to prevent versions of ceph before luminous
# from getting configs/files relating to nfs-ganesha.
#
# How to use this file:
#  1. Lines beginning with some number of spaces followed by '#' are a comment.
      # e.g., this is also a comment
#  2. Use only spaces as separators. As many spaces as desired can be used, but spaces only.
#  3. Blacklist format:  <path> <ENV_VAR1>=<val1>[,<val2>[,...]] [<ENV_VAR2>=...]
#     a. <path> can be individual files or directories.
#     b. Any number of environment variables can be specified. If an system environment variable
#        is set to any of the comma-delimited values associated with it, then the <path> will be
#        blacklisted.
#     c. Examples:
#        i.   some/file BASEOS_REG=ubuntu OS_VERSION=16.04
#               blacklists some/file for ubuntu:16.04 but not ubuntu:18.04
#        ii.  some/dir/ CEPH_VERSION=kraken,luminous
#               blacklists some/dir/ and all its contents for kraken and luminous but not mimic

# This line is contrived, but it makes sure that we can blacklist things that would normally
# override another. It also tests comma-delimited values.
tests/stage-test/ceph-releases/luminous/ubuntu/16.04/daemon/__DO_STUFF__ CEPH_VERSION=kraken,luminous OS_NAME=ubuntu

# This line makes sure that files are not blacklisted when they aren't supposed to be
tests/stage-test/ceph-releases/ALL/ubuntu/__MAINTAINER__ CEPH_VERSION=mimic
