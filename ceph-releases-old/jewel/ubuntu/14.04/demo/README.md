# Demo container

This Dockerfile may be used to bootstrap a Ceph cluster with all the Ceph daemons running.

**/!\ THIS CONTAINER IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USAGE /!\**

The main purpose of this container is to quickly get a Ceph cluster up and running by reducing all the setup steps. The container provides all the Ceph daemons, so you can rapidly start playing with Ceph.

## Usage

The environment variables `MON_NAME` and `MON_IP` are required:

- `MON_NAME` is the name of the monitor (DEFAULT: hostname)
- `MON_IP` is the IP address of the monitor (public)
- `RGW_NAME` is the name of rados gateway instance (DEFAULT: hostname)
- `RGW_CIVETWEB_PORT` is the port of the rados gateway (DEFAULT: 80)
- `CLUSTER` is the name of the cluster (DEFAULT: ceph)
- `CEPH_PUBLIC_NETWORK` is the network where the OSD should communicate
- `CEPH_DEMO_UID`, `CEPH_DEMO_ACCESS_KEY`, `CEPH_DEMO_SECRET_KEY`, and `CEPH_DEMO_BUCKET` can be used to auto-provision an account.

Commonly, you will want to bind-mount your host's `/etc/ceph` into the container. For example:

`docker run -d --net=host -v /etc/ceph:/etc/ceph -e MON_IP=192.168.0.20 -e CEPH_PUBLIC_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24 ceph/demo`

## Tip

If you get user_xattr error, try to remount your docker partition:

```
sudo mount -o remount,user_xattr,rw $(df -P /var/lib/docker |tail -1 |tr -s ' ' |cut -d' ' -f6)
```
