# image that points to both.

# Make an assumption that if we build an arm version of a flavor, we also build an x86 version.
# Because we don't make manifests for images without both x86 and arm variants, and because an arm
# flavor implies an x86 flavor is also built, we only need to start here with arm flavors.
